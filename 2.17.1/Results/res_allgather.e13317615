--------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[64314,0],0] on node r6i4n7
  Remote daemon: [[64314,0],1] on node r3i5n7

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
